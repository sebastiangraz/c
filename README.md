### Oh-My-Zsh

If you're using [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh), you can do:

1. `git clone git@github.com:robertzk/send.zsh.git ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/send`
2. `echo "plugins+=(send)" >> ~/.zshrc`

(Alternatively, you can add the `send` plugin to the `plugins=(...)` local in your `~/.zshrc` manually.)
